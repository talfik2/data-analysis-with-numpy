Top 30 Git Commands 
====================


Git is the most popular distributed version control system in the world.Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel, built this tool way back in 2005, which is currently an actively maintained open-source project. A huge number of open-source and commercial projects rely on Git for version control.

1. Set Up Your Username and Email 
=================================

The username is required to link commits with your name. It is not the same as your GitHub account username, which you use to login into your GitHub profile. You can set or update your username by using the `git config` command. The new name will automatically reflect in any future commits that you push to GitHub from the command line. If you want to hide your real name, you can use any arbitrary text as your Git username.

``` bash
git config --global user.name "user.name"
```

You can also use the `git config` command to update the email address that you want to associate with your Git commits. The new email address will automatically reflect in any future
commits that you push to GitHub from the command line.

```bash 
git config --global user.email "user.email"
```

2. Cache Your Login Credentials
===============================

You can cache(hide) your login credentials by using the `config` parameter and `--global` flag. It helps to avoid re-typing the username and password every time you perform a commit.

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

3. Initialize a Repository 
==========================

You can create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one by using the `init` parameter. It will create a hidden directory upon initialization. This directory contains all the objects and references that Git uses and creates as a part of your project's history.

```bash
git init
```

4. Add Individual File or All Files To Staging Area 
===================================================

You can add a single file to the staging area by using the `add` parameter and the name of the file. Just replace the `somefile.js` with your filename.

```bash
git add somefile.js
```

You can also add all files and directories to the staging area by providing the wildcard `.` instead of the file name.

```bash
git add .
```

5. Check a Repository Status 
============================

You can view the status of the current repository by using the `status` keyword, which includes the staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

```bash
git status
```

6. Commit Changes With a Single Line Message or Through an Editor 
=================================================================

You can add a single line message while making a commit in your repository by using the `commit` parameter, and `-m` flag. This message should immediately follow the flag and be wrapped in quotation marks.

```bash
git commit -m "Your short summary about the commit"
```

You can also open a text editor in the terminal to write a complete commit message. This message can contain multi-line text to allow you to explain the changes made to a repository in a detailed way.

```bash
git commit
```

7. View Commit History With Changes 
===================================

You can view the changes made in your repository by using the `log` parameter. It will show a list of the newest commits in sequential order. You can also check the detailed changes of each
file by adding the `-p` flag.

```bash
git log -p
```
* Do not forget to press `q` to quit.

8. View a Particular Commit 
===========================

You can see the detailed changes of a specific commit by using the `show` parameter and providing the ID or hash of the commit. This hash is unique for each commit made in your repository.

```bash
git show 1af17e73721dbe0c40011b82ed4bb1a7dbe3ce29
```

You can also provide a short hash to get the same result.

```bash
git show 1af17e
```

9. View Changes Before Committing 
=================================

You can view the list of changes made to your repository by using the `diff` parameter. It will only show the unstaged changes by default.

```bash
git diff
```

If you want to view the staged changes, you can add the `--staged` flag.

```bash
git diff --staged
```

You can also provide a filename as a parameter to only view the changes
of a specific file.

```bash
git diff somefile.js
```

10. Remove Tracked Files From The Current Working Tree
======================================================

You can remove files from the current working tree by using the `rm` parameter. This action will also remove the files from the index.

```bash
git rm dirname/somefile.js
```

You can also provide file globs (e.g., \*.js) to remove all matching files. 

```bash
git rm dirname/*.html
```

11. Rename Files 
================

You can rename a file or directory by using the `mv` parameter. This parameter requires a `<source>` and a `<destination>`. The source must exist and can be a file, or directory, and the destination must be an existing directory.

```bash
git mv dir1/somefile.js dir2
```

Executing the above command will move the source(s) into the target directory. The index will get updated, but you have to commit the changes.

12. Revert Unstaged and Staged Changes 
======================================

You can restore the unstaged working tree files by using the `checkout` parameter. You need to provide a file path to update it. If the file path is not set, then `git checkout` will update the HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.

```bash
git checkout somefile.js
```

To restore a staged working tree file, you can use the `reset parameter. You need to provide a file path to remove it from the staging area. This will not remove any changes or modifications done to the files, instead, the file will be considered as an unstaged file.

```bash
git reset HEAD somefile.js
```

If you want to unstage all staged files, then do not provide the file path.

```bash
git reset HEAD
```

13. Amend The Most Recent Commit 
================================

You can make changes to the most recent commit by using the `commit` parameter with the `--amend` flag. For instance, you just committed some files, and you remember that you have made a mistake in your commit message. In such a scenario, you can execute this command to edit the previous commit's message without modifying its snapshot.

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Updated message for the previous commit"
```

It is also possible to make changes to the previously committed files. For instance, you have updated some files in multiple folders that you folder to commit. Fixing this sort of error is just a matter of staging the other files or folders, and committing with the `--amend` and `--no-edit` flags.

```bash
git add dir1
git commit
# Here you forgot to add dir2 to commit, you can execute the following command to amend the other files and folders.git add dir2
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

The `--no-edit` flag will allow you to make the correction to your commit without altering its commit message. The final commit will then replace the incomplete one, and it will look like we
have committed the changes to all updated files and folders in one snapshot.

> **Alert !!! Don't amend public commits.\
> **Correcting a local commit with amend is excellent, and you are
> allowed to push it to a shared repository. But you should avoid
> amending commits that are already public. Remember that the amended
> commits are completely new commits, and the previous commit will not
> be available on your current branch. It has the same consequence as
> resetting a public snapshot.


14. Rollback Last Commit
========================

You can roll back the last commit by using the `revert` parameter. This will create a new commit, an inverse of the previous commit, and add it to the current branch history.

```bash
git revert HEAD
```

Revert v/s Reset 
----------------

The `git revert`command only undoes a single commit. It does not move back to the previous state of a project by removing all succeeding commits, which is done when `git reset` is used.

Reverting has two major benefits over resetting. First, it doesn't alter the project history, which makes it a safe operation for commits.
Second, it is able to target a specific commit at any point in the history, whereas git reset can only work backwards from the current commit. For instance, if you want to undo an old commit with git reset, you would have to remove all the commits that occurred after the target commit, then re-commit all the subsequent commits. Thus, the `git revert` is a much better and safer way to undo the changes.

15. Rollback a Particular Commit 
================================

You can roll back to a particular commit by using `revert` parameter and the commit ID. It will create a new commit, a copy of the provided commit ID, and add it to the current branch
history.

```bash
git revert 1af17e
```

16. Create and Switch To a New Branch 
=====================================

You can create a new branch by using the `branch` parameter and the name of the branch.

```bash
git branch new_branch_name
```

But Git won't switch to it automatically. If you want Git to auto-switch, you have to pass the `-b` flag and the `checkout` parameter.

```bash
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

17. List All Branches 
=====================

You can view the list of all branches by using the `branch` parameter. It will display all branches and mark the current branch with an asterisk (*) sign and highlight it.

```bash
git branch
```

You can also list all remote branches by using the `-a` flag.

```bash
git branch -a
```

18. Delete a Branch 
===================

You can delete a branch by using the `branch` parameter, `-d` flag and the name of the branch. If you've completed working on a branch and have merged it into the main branch, you can delete the branch without losing any history. However, if the branch hasn't been merged, the delete command will output an error message. This safeguards you from losing access to your files.

```bash
git branch -d existing_branch_name
```

If you want to forcibly delete a branch, you can use the capital `-D` flag. This will delete the branch despite its current status and without any warning.

```bash
git branch -D existing_branch_name
```

The above commands will only delete a local copy of the branch. The branch may exist in the remote repository. If you want to delete a remote branch, then execute the following command.

```bash
git push origin --delete existing_branch_name
```

19. Merge Two Branches 
======================

You can merge two branches by using the `merge` parameter and the name of the branch. This will combine the specified branch into the main branch.

```bash
git merge existing_branch_name
```

If you need a merge commit, you can execute git merge with the `--no-ff` flag.

```bash
git merge --no-ff existing_branch_name
```

The above command will merge the specified branch into the main branch and generate a merge commit. This is essential to document all merges that occur in your repository.

20. Show Commit Log as Graph For Current or All Branches 
========================================================

You can view the commit log as a graph for the current branch by using the `log` parameter and `--graph --oneline --decorate` flags. The `--graph` option will draw an ASCII graph, which
represents the branch structure of the commit history. When it used in association with the `--oneline` and `--decorate` flags, it makes it easier to identify which commit belongs to which branch.

```bash
git log --graph --oneline --decorate
```

If you want to see the commit log for all branches, you can use the `--all` flag.

```bash
git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate
```

21. Abort(Cancel) a Conflicting Merge 
=============================

You can abort a conflicting merge by using the `merge` parameter and the `--abort` flag. It allows you to exit from the merge process and return to the state after which the merge began.

```bash
git merge --abort
```

You can also use the `reset` parameter to during a merge conflict to reset the conflicted files to a stable state.

```bash
git reset
```

22. Add a Remote Repository 
===========================

You can add a remote repository by using the `remote add` parameter, `<shortname>` and the `<url>` of the remote repository.

```bash
git remote add awesomeapp https://github.com/someurl..
```

23. View Remote URLs 
====================

You can view the remote URLs by using the `remote` parameter and `-v` flag. This will list the remote connections you have to other repositories.

```bash
git remote -v
```

The above command is an interface to manage a list of remote entries that are stored in the repository's `.git/config` file.



24. Get Additional Information About a Remote Repository 
========================================================

You can get detailed information about a remote repository by using the `remote show` parameter and the name of the remote like `origin`.

```bash
git remote show origin
```

The above command will output a list of branches that are associated with the remote and also the endpoints that are connected to fetch and push files.

25. Push Changes To a Remote Repository 
=======================================

You can push changes to a remote repository by using the `push` parameter, name of the repository, and the name of the branch.

```bash
git push origin main
```

The above command will help you to upload the local changes to a central repository so that other team members can view the changes you have made.

26. Pull Changes From a Remote Repository 
=========================================

You can pull changes from a remote repository by using the `pull` parameter. This will fetch the specified remote's copy of the current branch and instantly merge it into the local copy.

```bash
git pull
```

You can also view the details of the files that have been downloaded, by using the `--verbose` flag.

```bash
git pull --verbose
```

27. Merge Remote Repository With Local Repository 
=================================================

You can merge a remote repository with your local repository by using the `merge` parameter and the name of the remote.

```bash
git merge master
```

28. Push a New Branch To Remote Repository 
==========================================

You can push a new branch to a remote repository by using the `push` parameter, `-u` flag, the name of the remote, and the name of the branch.

```bash
git push -u origin new_branch
```

29. Remove a Remote Branch 
==========================

You can remove a remote branch by using the `push` parameter, `--delete` flag, the name of the remote, and the name of the branch.

```bash
git push --delete origin existing_branch
```

30. Use Rebase 
==============

You can use this feature by using the `rebase` parameter and the name of the branch. Rebasing is a process to combine or move a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

```bash
git rebase branch_name
```

The above command will change the base of your branch from one commit to another, which will make it appear as if you have created your branch from a different commit. Git achieves this by creating new commits and applying them to the specified base. It's very necessary to understand that even though the branch looks the same, it's comprised of entirely new commits.
